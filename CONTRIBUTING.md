Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.

To accept the DCO, add this line to each commit message with your name and email address (`git commit -s` will do this for you):

## Pull request procedure

Pull requests should be targeted at the `main` branch. Before creating a pull request, go through this checklist:

1. Create a feature branch off of `main`.
2. [Rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) your local changes against `main`.
3. Run `make ci` and confirm that it passes: exactly the CI jobs, in order.
4. Accept the Developer's Certificate of Origin on all commits (see above).

All contributions are made via pull request. All patches from all contributors get reviewed. At least one review from a maintainer is required for all patches (even patches from maintainers). When CI fails, authors are expected to update the pull request until it passes.

Normally, all pull requests must include tests that cover your change. Occasionally, a change will be very difficult to test for; in those cases, include a note in your commit message explaining why.
