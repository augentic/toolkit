## Testing

Tests drive the public boundary: a behaviour is asserted through what a user of the product or crate can reach, over scripted doubles rather than a live filesystem, network, or model, never through private internals. A suite below the root survives only for an independent library contract; a unit test only for a branch no public boundary reaches. A test fn names the scenario (`gen_spec`, `no_sources`), never the outcome. Scripted doubles are strict: script exactly the exchanges a run consumes.
