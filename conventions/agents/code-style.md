## Code style

clippy (`make lint`) and nightly rustfmt (`make fmt`) are the style gate; beyond them and the rules below, match the surrounding code.

- Suppress a lint with `#[expect(lint, reason = "…")]` at the smallest scope, never `#[allow]`.
- `<module>.rs` plus `<module>/<child>.rs`; `mod.rs` only under `tests/support/`.
- A fn over a type is that type's method, not a free fn taking it as its first argument, where the type's module declares the fn or the fn is a plain lookup or predicate on the type. A constructor is an associated fn. A policy `const` sits beside the type whose method reads it. Values several fns thread through every call become one struct whose methods they are. A fn stays free when it is pure over primitives and iterators, or when it is one module's rule applied to another module's type.
